# CTF Team "HAW/THL" Write-Up Archive
Welcome to the official repository of the CTF Team "HAW/THL" where we document and archive our write-ups for various CTFs and Wargames. 

# About Us
We are a group of passionate cybersecurity enthusiasts from two different universities in Germany, dedicated to honing our skills and participating in CTF competitions.

# Write-Up Archive
In this repository, you'll find write-ups for challenges we've encountered during CTFs and Wargames. Each write-up provides a detailed explanation of the challenge, our approach to solving it, and any insights gained along the way.

# Why German?
As a German based university team, we write our write-ups in German to cater to our members and audience who are more comfortable with the language. This also allows us to communicate and collaborate more effectively within our team, ensuring everyone can contribute and understand the content fully.

Happy Hacking!
